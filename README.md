## Introduction

A sub-theme customized to optimize the Islandora experience.

## Installation
Installations instructions.

Create a /custom folder inside your /themes folder if it doesn't already exist (not necessary but highly recommended). Move to the newly created custom folder and clone this repository inside. Alternatively, you can also download the compressed repository and extract in the custom folder. Once you have the files in the appropriate directory you should see the Carapace for Islandora theme in the appearance tab. Click the 'Install and set as default' link and you should be ready to go.

This theme is a work in progress. If you have questions, suggestions, or comments, consider joining the Islandora User Interface Interest Group located at: https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-UI-Interest-Group.
