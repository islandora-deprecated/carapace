/**
 * Waypoints
 * Add styles to support waypoints.js. Waypoints is a way to trigger events when
 * the page is scrolled.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Load the library, for example in template suggestion:
 * - Add the .wp-waypoints class to element you want to apply the event to.
 * - Add data-wp-[] attributes. By default animations (using animate.css classes)
 *   and sticky are supported.
 * - If using animate classes turn these on in the Shortcodes > Animation
 *   extension in theme settings.
 *
 * E.g.:
 *
 *  {{- attach_library(theme.name ~ '/waypoints') -}}
 *   <div
 *     {{ attributes.addClass('wp-waypoint') }}  // class to initialize the waypoint.
 *     data-wp-sticky="true"                     // stick to the top as the user scrolls down.
 *     data-wp-animation="tada"                  // the animate.css class name.
 *     data-wp-animation-delay="1s"              // time to delay the animation.
 *     data-wp-animation-offset="bottom-in-view" // waypoints offset keyword or value.
